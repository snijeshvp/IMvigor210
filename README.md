---

**rawcounts**  
Raw gene expression data from the IMvigor210 project. This data typically includes counts of RNA transcripts for each gene, measured across various samples, providing insights into gene expression levels in the studied cohort.

---

**gene_info**  
Contains information about each gene, such as gene annotations, gene IDs, chromosomal locations, or functional descriptions. This data helps interpret gene expression data and facilitates downstream analyses.

---

**clinical**  
Clinical data for patients in the IMvigor210 cohort, including demographic information, treatment details, clinical outcomes, and other relevant health data. This dataset provides context for correlating gene expression and mutation data with patient characteristics and outcomes.

---

**Mut_Pheno**  
Mutation and phenotypic data, detailing mutations observed in each sample and possibly their functional consequences or phenotypic effects. This information helps link genetic variations to observable traits or disease characteristics.

---

**likely_short**  
Data on likely functional short variants, which may include short insertions, deletions, or point mutations. These variants are predicted to have functional significance based on bioinformatics analyses or prior studies.

---

**known_short**  
Data on known functional short variants, referencing variants previously documented in databases or scientific literature. This dataset serves as a reference for comparing new findings with established genetic knowledge.

---

**gain**  
Information on copy number gains, indicating genomic regions where the number of gene copies is higher than normal. These regions may contain genes that drive oncogenesis or influence disease progression when amplified.

---

**deletion**  
Contains data on copy number deletions, representing genomic regions with fewer copies than expected. These deletions can result in loss of tumor suppressor genes or other crucial regulatory elements, impacting cellular functions.

---

**amplification**  
High-level amplifications of gene copies in certain genomic regions, often indicative of significant oncogenic potential. These regions may harbor genes critical to cell proliferation, survival, or metastasis.

---

**human_gene_signatures**  
A collection of human gene signatures relevant to the IMvigor210 project, potentially encompassing pathway-specific, immune-related, or disease-associated gene sets. These signatures aid in interpreting expression data and understanding the biological processes at play.
